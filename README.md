0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

Project Description:

Within this project/task, I developed an interpreter designed for Monty ByteCodes. The interpreter has the capacity of parsing bytecode files and executing the instructions encoded within them.

Objectives:
To know the most common use cases of stacks and queues
To know the proper way to use global variables
To know what LIFO and FIFO mean
To know what a stack is, and when to use it
To know what a queue is, and when to use it
To know the common implementations of stacks and queues

Compilation:
These codes were compiled using: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
